For local testing in python virtual environment of mpi4py run the following commands: 

// create a new loval virtual environment
python3 -m venv ./venv

// activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

// upgrade pip 
pip3 install --upgrade pip

// upgrade apt
sudo apt update

// install pip req. files for mpi4py
sudo apt-get install libopenmpi-dev

// install mpi4py - python library which will parallelize processes on the cluster
pip install mpi4py

// up to this point you should have working environment ready to test locally your mpi4py script
// [KEEP IN MIND] to run the mpi4py script locally, you must execute:
mpirun -np 2 python3 YOURSCRIPT.py
// [REMEMBER] because of the extended cmd execution command line arguments have different indexation.
// [REMEMBER] np args defines the number of parallel tasks


// SAVING RESULTS
My advice is to transfer logic of writing to file out of the MPI4PY. You can execute append to file
from the position of your script. For python it would be: 

with open('results.csv', 'a') as f:
    f.write('{},{},{}\n'.format(index1, index2, result))


In this way you will have single csv file just executing scripts in parallel.
